# Disaster-Recovery-Speed-Prediction-System
A comprehensive machine learning system that predicts recovery speeds for communities affected by natural disasters (floods and earthquakes). This project supports SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities by helping identify which areas will recover fastest or slowest after disasters, enabling better resource allocation and preparedness planning

Natural disasters affect millions of people annually, with recovery times varying dramatically between communities. This system uses advanced analytics to predict recovery patterns, helping governments, NGOs, and disaster response organizations make data-driven decisions about resource allocation and preparedness investments.
The system combines survival analysis techniques with machine learning to analyze multiple factors including infrastructure quality, population density, economic conditions, and disaster preparedness levels to predict community recovery times.
